I start a FaceRecognition. <br>
This was to test, because for [JonasOS]() i want to test a camera tracking and face recognition. <br>

To test the skript install cv2. <br>
``pip install cv2`` <br>

Run ``python DetectFaceinWebCam.py`` and a Window will open. All faces will be detected and marked with a box. <br>

To use DetectDaceInPicture.py put your Picture in the images folder. <br>
Run ``python DetectFaceInPicture.py`` and the Picture will be in the output folder with the faces marked. <br>
